/**
 * This class models an email message. This is an abstract class.  
 * Subclasses provide actual implementations. <p>
 *
 * Message implements the Part interface. Message contains a set of
 * attributes and a "content". Messages within a folder also have a 
 * set of flags that describe its state within the folder.<p>
 *
 * Message defines some new attributes in addition to those defined
 * in the <code>Part</code> interface. These attributes specify meta-data
 * for the message - i.e., addressing  and descriptive information about 
 * the message. <p>
 *
 * Message objects are obtained either from a Folder or by constructing
 * a new Message object of the appropriate subclass. Messages that have
 * been received are normally retrieved from a folder named "INBOX". <p>
 *
 * A Message object obtained from a folder is just a lightweight
 * reference to the actual message. The Message is 'lazily' filled 
 * up (on demand) when each item is requested from the message. Note
 * that certain folder implementations may return Message objects that
 * are pre-filled with certain user-specified items.
 
 * To send a message, an appropriate subclass of Message (e.g., 
 * MimeMessage) is instantiated, the attributes and content are 
 * filled in, and the message is sent using the <code>Transport.send</code> 
 * method. <p>
